##sentence-parsing-test

This is a typescript and node based project used to test basic data structure manipulation

If typescript is not installed on your system, install it using:

```npm install -g typescript```

To install the project dependencies, run:

`npm i`

Now you can build your solution. It should satisfy the requirements given to you for 
your challenge.

An endpoint has been set up for you in index.ts at '/sentence'. You may choose to use this, in which case, you should place your solution
in parser.ts and make sure it allows the parseSentence function to run in index.ts, or you may rewrite the endpoint to suit your needs.

Once you have a completed solution, build the typescript using: 

```tsc```

The program can be run using

```npm start```
